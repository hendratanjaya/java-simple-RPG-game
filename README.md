# simple-RPG-game

This a simple RPG game build with JAVA, this project helped me undertstand various OOP concepts such **encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism**.
This is by far the most complex yet the most enjoyable console app and I ever build, this is also an assigment project when I was a Laboratory Assistant Trainee in my university, I build this project after I finished this [Project](https://github.com/hendratanjaya/trading-app-simulator).
The code is pretty messy due my lack of experience of handling Object Orientep Program, but I hope the code is still readable.
